## Available features

* QAM/PSK signal generation with [Commpy](https://github.com/veeresht/CommPy)
* Numerical models to simulate optical transmitters, nonlinear propagation over optical fibers, and optical receivers.
* CPU and GPU-based implementations of the [*split-step Fourier Method*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-step_method) to simulate polarization multiplexed WDM transmission.
* Standard digital signal processing (DSP) blocks employed in coherent optical receivers.
* Tools to evaluate transmission performance metrics such as *bit-error-rate* (BER), *symbol-error-rate* (SER), *mutual information* (MI), *generalized mutual information* (GMI).
